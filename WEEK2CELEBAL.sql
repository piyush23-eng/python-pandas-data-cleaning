SELECT DISTINCT category FROM products;
-- Q4: Primary Keys in each table
-- customers   → customer_id
-- products    → product_id
-- orders      → order_id
-- order_items → item_id
--
-- A Primary Key must be UNIQUE because every row needs to be
-- individually identifiable. If two rows had the same ID, JOINs
-- would break and return wrong data.
-- It must be NOT NULL because a row with unknown identity
-- cannot be referenced by foreign keys in other tables.

-- Q5: Constraints on email column
-- 1. UNIQUE  → no two customers can have the same email
-- 2. NOT NULL → every customer must provide an email
--
-- Try inserting duplicate email to see the error:

VALUES (109,'Test','User','aarav.s@email.com','Surat','Gujarat','2024-09-01',FALSE);
